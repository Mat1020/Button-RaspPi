**Step 4:** <br>
Connect the GND jumper to the negative row of the breadboard (Right Side)

**Step 5:** <br>
Connect a piece of wire (or male jumper) between the negative row and the 12 column of the breadboard (Right Side)

**Step 6:** <br>
Put the button between 10 and 12 column of the breadboard (Right Side)
